## Folder structure

All programs are contained within the root folder in GitHub. They follow the naming convention:

- 2 digit number - indicates the order in which program should be one (10* are for importing raw data, 20* are for descriptive statistics, etc.)
- one letter (a or b) - a is for Stata code, b is for R code
- lower case roman numeral (i, ii, etc.) or number, e.g. 8 - indicates the IPUMS CPS dataset used in the program (e.g. "iv" uses cps00004.dta, "8" uses cps00008.dta)

## Branch structure

The only branch is 'main' which is the default branch in GitHub. There are no other branches.
